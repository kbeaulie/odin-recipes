In this project I will be creating a website that has many different recipes on it.
When I have finished I will have demonstrated the ability to:
     use anchors to create links to different webpages on the site and to other sites on the internet
     Create different types of lists using <ul> and <ol>, creating list items with <li>
     Use different types of headers depending on what types are needed using <h1>,<h2>,<h3>etc
     use <strong> and <em> to bold or italicize text
     demonstrate ability to create an html boilerplate from scratch
